# Boolean Expressions and Conditionals

In this lab you will learn:

- How to use Boolean expressions in Python
- Why and how to combine Boolean operators
- Why conditional statements are so important

## What are Boolean Expressions?

A **Boolean expressions** is one that has a value of either **True** or **False**.

**Boolean operators** are the comparison operators that we use in Boolean expressions: `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `==` (equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `!=` (not equal to).

## Conditional Statements

### The `if` Statement

We use boolean expressions with **if statements** to execute different parts of code, depending on different circumstances. For example:

```python
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
```

In our code, we assume that `x` and `y` have already been initialized or set to some other values beforehand.

We use indentation to indicate the lines of code that will run if the statement is true.

We also have **if-else** statements which will execute either one branch or the other:

```python
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x is not less than y")
```

The `else` captures all cases that donâ€™t match the first condition.

{% next %}

And finally we can have more than two branches by combining multiple **if-else** statements:

```python
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
```

To compare two values, you use `==`, two equal signs. Remember from previous labs that the single `=` sign represents assignment.

## Combining Boolean Expressions

We can combine Boolean expressions by using the **logical operators**.  `and` will evaluate to `true` if both expressions on either side of it are true. `or` evaluates to `true` if at least one of the two expressions on either side is true. And `not` evaluates to the opposite of whatever the expression after it evaluates to.

We can now execute a block of code only if multiple conditions are true as in:

```python
if age > 12 and age < 20:
    print("You are officially a teenager!")
```

## Grades

You have two problems to solve in this lab. First, let's look at `grades.py`.

If you try to run the code in `grades.py` on the right, you'll see there's a problem. If the user inputs `95`, all four statements print out!

```
$ python grades.py
Enter your grade (between 60 and 100): 95
You got an A!
You got a B!
You got a C!
You got a D!
```

Fix the program so that only the correct statement prints out.

Make sure to test your code by entering a variety of numbers between 60 and 100.

{% next %}

## Even or odd

Now look at `odd_even.py`. This program asks the user to input a number.

Your task is to print "Odd" or "Even" depending on the number that was entered. When you run the program, it should look like this:

```
$ python odd_even.py
Enter a number: 7
Odd

$ python odd_even.py
Enter a number: 6
Even
```

Don't forget to test your code and make sure it outputs the right response!

### How to Check Your Code

Once you've tested the programs yourself, execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`. But be sure to always test it yourself as well!

```
check50 scienceacademy/problems/2021/7/conditionals
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```
style50 grades.py
```

and

```
style50 odd_even.py
```

{% next %}

## How to Submit

Execute the below, logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your password.

```
submit50 scienceacademy/problems/2021/7/conditionals
```
